Description: Eigen-R2 is a high-dimensional version of the classical R-square statistic, 
aggregating R-square values over many related response variables via an eigen-decomposition. 
This package calculates eigen-R2 for a matrix of related response variables according to a 
model matrix built from a set of independent variables.
